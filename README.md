# Influence-Maximization
Influence maximization is a problem in network analysis, particularly in the context
of social networks, where the goal is to identify a subset of nodes that, when influenced, maximizes the spread of influence throughout the network.

The primary objective is to strategically select a small set of influential nodes that can trigger a cascading effect, leading to the widest possible adoption of an idea, behavior, or product.
The problem is NP-hard, meaning that finding the optimal solution in polynomial time is computationally infeasible. Therefore, heuristic approaches are commonly employed to find suboptimal but reasonably effective solutions.

Influence maximization has applications in various domains, including viral marketing, information dissemination, product promotion, and behavior change campaigns. It helps identify key individuals whose adoption of an innovation can lead to widespread acceptance.
